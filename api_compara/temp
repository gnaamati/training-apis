About Triticum aestivum
Triticum aestivum (bread wheat) is a major global cereal grain essential to human nutrition. Wheat was one of 
the first cereals to be domesticated, originating in the fertile crescent around 7000 years ago. Bread wheat is 
hexaploid, with a genome size estimated at ~17 Gbp, composed of three closely-related and independently 
maintained genomes that are the result of a series of naturally occurring hybridization events. The ancestral 
progenitor genomes are considered to be Triticum urartu (the A-genome donor) and an unknown grass thought to be 
related to Aegilops speltoides (the B-genome donor). This first hybridization event produced tetraploid emmer 
wheat (AABB, T. dicoccoides) which hybridized again with Aegilops tauschii (the D-genome donor) to produce 
modern bread wheat.

Assembly

The IWGSC RefSeq v1.0, comprised of Illumina short sequence reads assembled with NRGeneÂ’s DeNovoMAGIC software, 
produced scaffolds totaling 14.5Gb with a chromosomal scaffold/superscaffold N50 of 22.8 Mb.
Scaffolds have been assigned to chromosomal locations using POPSEQ data and a HiC map. Over 99% of chromosome 
survey contigs map to the new assembly. 

Annotation

The IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 annotation includes gene models generated by integrating predictions made by INRA-GDEC 
using Triannot and PGSB using their customised pipeline (previously MIPS pipeline). The integration was 
undertaken by the Earlham institute (EI), who have also added UTRs to the gene models where supporting data are 
available. Gene models have been assigned to high confidence (HC) or low confidence (LC) classes based on 
completeness, similarity to genes represented in protein and DNA databases and repeat content. The automated 
assignment of functional annotation to genes has been generated by PGSB based on AHRD parameters.
The annotation includes 110,790 high confidence genes, 158,793 low confidence genes and 13,044 long coding RNAs.
98,270 high confidence genes from the TGACv1 annotation were aligned to the assembly using Exonerate[x]. For 
each gene up to 3 alignments are displayed, compromising 196,243 alignments of which 90,686 are protein coding.

Variation:

768664 markers from the 820K Axiom SNP array from CerealsDB were aligned to the assembly. 
This was done by CerealsDB using Blast with a cutoff of 1e-05. The top three hits were parsed and compared to 
CerealsDB genetic map data. In cases where two or more of the top three hits had an identical score, the hit 
agreed with the genetic map was selected. In cases of no genetic map information for a particular SNP then the 
top hit was selected.
